# Reviewsis and Twitterment
tkinter UI tools for Sentiment Analysis on reviews in a csv file or public tweets.

Preferable to use Python 3+ version.

External dependencies required : pandas, tweepy, textblob, matplotlib.

# Installing Pandas module
If you are running Python 3.5 we have given the Pandas module .whl file under the Packages directory.
To install in open the directory in the command prompt/shell and run the pip3 install command along with the .whl file name.

The UI is relatively straightforward.
