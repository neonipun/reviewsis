Since we were only there for 24hours, it was a good spot to stay as it was walking distance to the Acropolis and Plaka area. Vesna and Kosta were great at communicating and when we checked in, Kosta was very helpful in explaining the area and everything we needed to know.

The apartment is in an excellent area, 3 minutes walk to the metro station Bastille, with a gorgeous farmer's market each Thursday and Sunday across the street (buy the eggs!). Michiko and her boyfriend were very welcoming during my stay, answering any queries I had about the neighbourhood, and giving some general tips about Paris.The room is a nice size with a comfortable bed, and the place overall has a nice feel to it. Although, some door handles are a little out of order, and the internet works best in the living room. They also have an adorable puppy who is very playful and loving.

9329281,2013-12-03,"This is not our first time to NYC, but this is the first time using AirBnb here. When staying at most hotels in Midtown, you have to expect high prices for ""Holiday Inn"" quality small rooms, despite the hotels rated as 4 or 5 stars. Everything seems old here.Not here. The owner has good taste. The unit is modern and updated. Small but larger than most hotel rooms. We loved the kitchen granite counters, modern kitchen stove, plush rugs, and modern couch. Plus, we get a 1 bedroom unit so that we can let our baby sleep in one room while we get to enjoy watching TV on the large 50-60"" TV in the living room. Surprisingly, there is another huge TV in the bedroom as well which we never used. All ""high definition,"" of course.The owner is very professional and courteous. He answered all of our questions and accommodated all of our needs. When I inquired about a baby crib, he responded by ordering one for us immediately. Also, when we arrived at the unit, he told us that he ordered a high chair for another client but we are welcomed to use it as well. I never used the high chair but it is telling how willing he is to help out. The owner met us in person in the unit and explained rules of the unit. My wife and I felt very comfortable with him. We also noticed that he had fresh red roses on the coffee table for us. Nice touch and good taste!Location is perfect in Midtown with a few minute walk to most train stations, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center. Area is safe!!! We have no worries of our safety or security in the building or surrounding area. Neighbors are quiet and overall seem genuinely nice. We have a view of the street which is not saying much since you are surrounded by other tall building. To be expected and not big deal deal since we are going out to enjoy the town. In the morning while sleeping, we do hear car and street noises. Again to be expected in Midtown. Our baby didn't mind even during her daytime naps!We enjoyed our stay in NYC using this Airbnb unit more than a typical hotel room. It met all of our needs and more so. The owner was great and made this stay a very memorable experience. Thank you.",FANTASTIC TIMES SQUARE ONE BEDROOM,Theater District,New York City,New York,United States,Entire home/apt,260,291

Water pressure in shower was strong, and water hot.Free washer and dryer! Reasonably priced.Free Wifi!Cons:Old house in need of much fixing and a really, really good scrubbing by professional cleaners maybe?Door made explosive sound every time we opened it (probably woke everyone up in building)Large windows facing next door windows, but, alas, no curtains. But that's ok, when we had to get dressed, we turned the lights out, or snuck into the tiny closet.  Privacy is really overrated anyway. Booked for 2, but there was only 1 tiny pillow on bed (no biggie, but you might want to bring your own, and maybe another sheet as there was no top sheet).Bathroom had a very Third World feel to it.

He was also open to all our questions and inquiries. The location was wonderful in consideration of historical landmarks. Situated between 2 Tube Stations. The only problem was the noise level. Every weekday morning the Street Market people start setting up at 6am. And of course you can hear them. Then on the other hand you can hear the noise from the pub next door until about midnight Thur and Fri nights. The house was exactly like stated. We didnt use kitchen so I cant attest to it.

There's a variety of restaurants, boutiques and particularly good coffee shops (of the coffee bean kind!) nearby.The studio itself has some beautiful design features; the hardwood floors, the quirky lighting and the sturdy table were personal favourites! The bed, also a convertible sofa, was extremely comfortable and cosy.  Although a studio, there was plenty of space for our luggage and Arne has all the usual household appliances available to guests. Arne was a faultless host; meeting us when we arrived, giving us local recommendations and was only ever an instant message away.

There is also a metro stop extremely close by, so very convenient for traveling.However, the appartment itself is just okay at best, which is fine if you're out all day anyway. The things I didn't like were the smell from the kitchen below coming especially into the bedroom, the shower drain getting clogged, the doves that like to hang out next to the bedroom window cooing all morning, and the laundry facility being in the restaurant basement... But it was quiet, had a lovely balcony and good kitchen facilities.I also have to admit that the quality of her restaurant, just below the apartment, I found low. I had a 'green soup' that was possibly spinach, I couldn't really tell, and overcooked sticky pasta in cream sauce that was not very good. However, in fairness, all the food we ate in Brussels was much worse than any other city we stayed because I think the demand for high quantity production is so high to meet the demand of millions of tourists each day, the quality is really lost.Aside from that, Dominique herself was very nice and great at communicating before our visit. She did seem like she was slightly tired of meeting a million people that stay at her place, so was very straight forward... but still nice.","Heart of Brussels,Halles St. Gery",Bruxelles,Brussels,Brussels,Belgium,Entire home/apt,85,342
