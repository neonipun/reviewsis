41133812,2012-05-08,"The apartment was situated on the first floor of the building, which was fantastic as we didn't have to carry bags up and down stairs for the one night we stayed there. It was great for the price and the description accurate. Not much natural light into the room, but it's not an issue if you aren't going to be there long. Was great for the one night we stayed in it, and the check in and check out was super easy. Wifi and kitchen facilities were great.

7465026,2013-08-16,"Even though it was only for one night, we had a wonderful stay at Vesna and Kostas apartment, everything was very modern and clean. Since we were only there for 24hours, it was a good spot to stay as it was walking distance to the Acropolis and Plaka area. Vesna and Kosta were great at communicating and when we checked in, Kosta was very helpful in explaining the area and everything we needed to know. What was really great was that they had printed maps for us and also a local mobile phone incase we needed to make calls! They were also very accomodating with holding our bags after we checked out as we had a late flight. Great place, definitely recommend!",Acropolis Apartment brand new,ΑΚΡΟΠΟΛΗ,Athens,Attica,Greece,Entire home/apt,62,281

Tyler was very nice and the room was comfortable and well air-conditioned. We had a minor issue with the wi-fi due to a provider outage so be aware if you have a strong need for internet access, but overall a great experience.

23793633,2013-02-01,"Staying at Michiko's apartment for 6 nights was my first AirBnB experience. The apartment is in an excellent area, 3 minutes walk to the metro station Bastille, with a gorgeous farmer's market each Thursday and Sunday across the street (buy the eggs!). Michiko and her boyfriend were very welcoming during my stay, answering any queries I had about the neighbourhood, and giving some general tips about Paris.The room is a nice size with a comfortable bed, and the place overall has a nice feel to it. Although, some door handles are a little out of order, and the internet works best in the living room. They also have an adorable puppy who is very playful and loving. I'd recommend staying here if you want to experience inner Paris, staying with friendly people, for a small price.Cheers!",Room near Bastille and Marais,Popincourt,Paris,Île-de-France,France,Private room,39,246

9329281,2013-12-03,"This is not our first time to NYC, but this is the first time using AirBnb here. When staying at most hotels in Midtown, you have to expect high prices for ""Holiday Inn"" quality small rooms, despite the hotels rated as 4 or 5 stars. Everything seems old here.Not here. The owner has good taste. The unit is modern and updated. Small but larger than most hotel rooms. We loved the kitchen granite counters, modern kitchen stove, plush rugs, and modern couch. Plus, we get a 1 bedroom unit so that we can let our baby sleep in one room while we get to enjoy watching TV on the large 50-60"" TV in the living room. Surprisingly, there is another huge TV in the bedroom as well which we never used. All ""high definition,"" of course.The owner is very professional and courteous. He answered all of our questions and accommodated all of our needs. When I inquired about a baby crib, he responded by ordering one for us immediately. Also, when we arrived at the unit, he told us that he ordered a high chair for another client but we are welcomed to use it as well. I never used the high chair but it is telling how willing he is to help out. The owner met us in person in the unit and explained rules of the unit. My wife and I felt very comfortable with him. We also noticed that he had fresh red roses on the coffee table for us. Nice touch and good taste!Location is perfect in Midtown with a few minute walk to most train stations, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center. Area is safe!!! We have no worries of our safety or security in the building or surrounding area. Neighbors are quiet and overall seem genuinely nice. We have a view of the street which is not saying much since you are surrounded by other tall building. To be expected and not big deal deal since we are going out to enjoy the town. In the morning while sleeping, we do hear car and street noises. Again to be expected in Midtown. Our baby didn't mind even during her daytime naps!We enjoyed our stay in NYC using this Airbnb unit more than a typical hotel room. It met all of our needs and more so. The owner was great and made this stay a very memorable experience. Thank you.",FANTASTIC TIMES SQUARE ONE BEDROOM,Theater District,New York City,New York,United States,Entire home/apt,260,291
